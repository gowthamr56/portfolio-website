## St-Caffeine
St-Caffeine is a GitHub Actions workflow to keep this website awake. Because streamlit apps without traffic for 7 consecutive days will automatically go to sleep. To not let this website sleep, this workflow will push a commit every 5 days. After every push, the Streamlit app will be updated.
